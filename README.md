# Project Overview

This project is a study of transfer learning in image classification with a specialized
focus on binary classification of chest X-ray images. It involves:
- Training a ResNet-18 model without freezing any layers.
- Addressing overfitting and poor accuracy using data augmentation, L2 regularization, and learning rate adjustment.
- Experimenting with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to determine the optimal number of layers to freeze.
